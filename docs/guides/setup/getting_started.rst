Setup
-----

Reserving Hugepages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hugepages must be enabled for running DPDK with high performance.
Hugepage support is required to reserve large amount size of pages,
2MB or 1GB per page, to less TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffers) and
to reduce cache miss.
Less TLB means that it reduce the time for translating virtual address
to physical.

Hugepage reservation might be different for 2MB or 1GB.

For 1GB page, hugepage setting must be activated while booting system.
It must be defined in boot loader configuration, usually is
``/etc/default/grub``.
Add an entry to define pagesize and the number of pages.
Here is an example. `` hugepagesz`` is for the size and ``hugepages``
is for the number of pages.

.. code-block:: console

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=8"

.. note::

    1GB hugepages might not be supported in your machine. It depends on
    that CPUs support 1GB pages or not. You can check it by referring
    ``/proc/cpuinfo``. If it is supported, you can find ``pdpe1gb`` in
    the ``flags`` attribute.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | pdpe1gb

For 2MB page, you can activate hugepages while booting or at anytime
after system is booted.
Define hugepages setting in ``/etc/default/grub`` to activate it while
booting, or overwrite the number of 2MB hugepages as following.

.. code-block:: console

    $ echo 1024 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages

In this case, 1024 pages of 2MB (totally 2048 MB) are reserved.


Mount hugepages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make the memory available for using hugepages from DPDK.

.. code-block:: console

    mkdir /mnt/huge
    mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge

It is also available while booting by adding a configuration of mount
point in ``/etc/fstab``, or after booted.

The mount point for 2MB or 1GB can be made permanent accross reboot.
For 2MB, it is no need to declare the size of hugepages explicity.

.. code-block:: console

    nodev /mnt/huge hugetlbfs defaults 0 0

For 1GB, the size of hugepage must be specified.

.. code-block:: console

    nodev /mnt/huge_1GB hugetlbfs pagesize=1GB 0 0


Install DPDK and SPP
--------------------

Before using SPP, you need to install DPDK.
In this document, briefly describ how to install and setup DPDK.
Refer to `DPDK documentation
<https://dpdk.org/doc/guides/>`_ for more details.
For Linux, see `Getting Started Guide for Linux
<http://www.dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/index.html>`_ .

First, download and compile DPDK in any directory.
Compiling DPDK takes a few minutes.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd /path/to/any
    $ git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
    $ cd dpdk
    $ export RTE_SDK=$(pwd)
    $ export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc  # depends on your env
    $ make install T=$RTE_TARGET

Then, download and compile SPP in any directory.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd /path/to/any
    $ git clone http://dpdk.org/git/apps/spp
    $ cd spp
    $ make  # Confirm that $RTE_SDK and $RTE_TARGET are set


Binding Network Ports to DPDK
-----------------------------

Network ports must be bound to DPDK with a UIO (Userspace IO) driver.
UIO driver is for mapping device memory to userspace and registering
interrupts.

UIO Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~

You usually use the standard ``uio_pci_generic`` for many use cases
or ``vfio-pci`` for more robust and secure cases.
Both of drivers are included by default in modern Linux kernel.

.. code-block:: console

    # Activate uio_pci_generic
    $ sudo modprobe uio_pci_generic

    # or vfio-pci
    $ sudo modprobe vfio-pci

You can also use kmod included in DPDK instead of ``uio_pci_generic``
or ``vfio-pci``.

.. code-block:: console

    sudo modprobe uio
    sudo insmod kmod/igb_uio.ko

Binding Network Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once UIO driver is activated, bind network ports with the driver.
DPDK provides ``usertools/dpdk-devbind.py`` for managing devices.

Find ports for binding to DPDK by running the tool with ``-s`` option.

.. code-block:: console

    $ $RTE_SDK/usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --status

    Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
    ============================================
    <none>

    Network devices using kernel driver
    ===================================
    0000:29:00.0 '82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) 10bc' if=enp41s0f0 drv=e1000e unused=
    0000:29:00.1 '82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) 10bc' if=enp41s0f1 drv=e1000e unused=
    0000:2a:00.0 '82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) 10bc' if=enp42s0f0 drv=e1000e unused=
    0000:2a:00.1 '82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) 10bc' if=enp42s0f1 drv=e1000e unused=

    Other Network devices
    =====================
    <none>
    ....

You can find network ports are bound to kernel driver and not to DPDK.
To bind a port to DPDK, run ``dpdk-devbind.py`` with specifying a driver
and a device ID.
Device ID is a PCI address of the device or more friendly style like
``eth0`` found by ``ifconfig`` or ``ip`` command..

.. code-block:: console

    # Bind a port with 2a:00.0 (PCI address)
    ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=uio_pci_generic 2a:00.0

    # or eth0
    ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=uio_pci_generic eth0


After binding two ports, you can find it is under the DPDK driver and
cannot find it by using ``ifconfig`` or ``ip``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ $RTE_SDK/usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -s

    Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
    ============================================
    0000:2a:00.0 '82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) 10bc' drv=uio_pci_generic unused=vfio-pci
    0000:2a:00.1 '82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) 10bc' drv=uio_pci_generic unused=vfio-pci

    Network devices using kernel driver
    ===================================
    0000:29:00.0 '82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) 10bc' if=enp41s0f0 drv=e1000e unused=vfio-pci,uio_pci_generic
    0000:29:00.1 '82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) 10bc' if=enp41s0f1 drv=e1000e unused=vfio-pci,uio_pci_generic

    Other Network devices
    =====================
    <none>
    ....


Run DPDK Sample Application
---------------------------

You had better to run DPDK sample application before SPP
as checking DPDK is setup properly.

Try ``l2fwd`` as an example.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd $RTE_SDK/examples/l2fwd
   $ make
     CC main.o
     LD l2fwd
     INSTALL-APP l2fwd
     INSTALL-MAP l2fwd.map

In this case, run this application with two options.

  - -c: core mask
  - -p: port mask

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo ./build/app/l2fwd \
     -c 0x03 \
     -- -p 0x3

It must be separated with ``--`` to specify which option is
for EAL or application.
Refer to `L2 Forwarding Sample Application
<https://dpdk.org/doc/guides/sample_app_ug/l2_forward_real_virtual.html>`_
for more details.
