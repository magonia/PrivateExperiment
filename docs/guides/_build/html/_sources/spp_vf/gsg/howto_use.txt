How to Use
==========

SPP Controller
--------------

First, run SPP Controller with port numbers for spp primary and secondary.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python ./src/spp_vf.py -p 5555 -s 6666


SPP Primary
-----------

SPP primary allocates and manages resources for secondary processes.
You need to run SPP primary before secondary processes.

SPP primary has two kinds of options for DPDK and spp.
Before ``--`` are for DPDK is, and after ``--`` are for spp.

See `Running a Sample Application
<http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/build_sample_apps.html#running-a-sample-application>`_
in DPDK documentation for options.

Options of spp primary are:

  * -p : port mask
  * -n : number of rings
  * -s : IPv4 address and port for spp primary

Then, spp primary can be launched like this.

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo ./src/primary/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/spp_primary \
      -c 0x02 -n 4 --socket-mem 512,512 \
      --huge-dir=/run/hugepages/kvm \
      --proc-type=primary \
      -- -p 0x03 -n 9 -s 127.0.0.1:5555

SPP Secondary
-------------

spp secondary processes(``spp_vf``) can be launched with two kinds of
options, like primary process.

Like primary process, ``spp_vf`` has two kinds of options. One is for
DPDK, the other is ``spp_vf``.

``spp_vf`` specific options are:

  * --client-id: client id
  * -s: IPv4 address and port for spp secondary
  * --vhost-client: vhost-user client enable setting

``spp_vf`` can be launched like this.

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo ./src/vf/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/spp_vf \
    -c 0x3ffd -n 4 --proc-type=secondary \
    -- --client-id 1 -s 127.0.0.1:6666 --vhost-client

If ``--vhost-client`` option is specified, then ``vhost-user`` act as
the client, otherwise the server.
For reconnect feature from SPP to VM, ``--vhost-client`` option can be
used. This reconnect features requires QEMU 2.7 (or later).
See also `Vhost Sample Application
<http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/sample_app_ug/vhost.html>`_.

VM
--

Launch VMs with ``virsh`` command.

.. code-block:: console

    $ virsh start [VM]


Additional Network Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable processes running on the VM to communicate through spp,
it is required additional network configurations on host and guest VMs.

(1) Guest VMs

.. code-block:: console

    # Interface for vhost
    $ sudo ifconfig [IF_NAME] inet [IP_ADDR] netmask [NETMASK] up

    # Disable offload for vhost interface
    $ sudo ethtool -K [IF_NAME] tx off

(2) Host2

.. code-block:: console

    # Disable offload for VM interface
    $ ethtool -K [IF_NAME] tx off
